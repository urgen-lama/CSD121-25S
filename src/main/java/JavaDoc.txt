Main.java
    In Main.java I created a program that will prompt user to enter their name and a number between 1 to 100.
    The int randomNumber = ((int)(Math.random()*100)); function generates random numbers between 1 to 100.
    If the user inputs the right answer then a message will show up and if the user did not input the right answer then
        the program will tell them to try again.
    User can exit from the program by providing numbers from -1 to below.
    The result will be saved in Result.txt file.
    (In this program I did not use Arrays and arguments)

Main1.java
    In Main1.java I created a program that will prompt user to input correct password to see the marks.
        Password = 12345678
    If the user did not provide correct password then the program will break with a message.
    If the user provide correct password then the program will again ask him to provide student ID.
        Student ID = 4444
    After providing the student ID the user can see the marks.
